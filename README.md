# CollectiveMigration
This is code for analising collecive cell migration (CCM) data although in practice it could also be applied to other data sources. This is downstream from particle-image velocimetry processing to generate a time-series vectorfield which is the input to this package.

The package calculates vital statics for charactering CCM including Vrms, persistance length and instantaneous order parameter. There is also limited support for analysing rotational behaviour.

Visualisation of cell movement (Output will be higher resoltion).
